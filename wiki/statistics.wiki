#summary LZHAM codec performance information on popular compression test files.

LZHAM is now listed on the Large Text Compression Benchmark page:
http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text.html

As of Aug. 30, 2010 only the alpha2 x86 version of the codec has been tested, using a 64MB dictionary with the "default" compression level.

Interestingly, once you sort this list by decompression speed, LZHAM is among the top 20 fastest decompressors listed. Of those 20, it has the 2nd best compression ratio. (The closed source "lzturbo" codec has a higher compression ratio and decompresses at 20ns/byte vs. LZHAM's 21ns/byte.)

However, LZHAM is capable of better compression. Here are the results from the alpha3 x64 version of the compressor using a 512MB dictionary in "Uber" mode (using the -d29 -m4 command line options):

  * LZHAM alpha3 enwik8: Input file size: 100,000,000, Compressed file size: 24,954,329
  * LZHAM alpha3 enwik9: Input file size: 1,000,000,000, Compressed file size: 206,393,809

lzturbo now beats LZHAM on enwik9, but lzturbo is still very slightly ahead on enwik8:

  * lzturbo 0.94 enwik8: 24,763,542  
  * lzturbo 0.94 enwik9: 217,342,694

Here's the output from the lzhamtest_x64 running under Win7 x64 on a 2.6 GHz Core i7 with 6MB RAM:
